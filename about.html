While attending college, one day I stumbled upon a nightly poker game. Having had no exposure to poker, I was shocked at the analytical nature of the game. At its root, poker is a game about trying to make optimal decisions based upon imperfect information. I began playing poker nightly, supplementing my political science education with poker books and poker discussions on online poker community forums.  Within a year, I was an online poker professional, and have been ever since.  Daily study and reevaluation of strategy are among the minimum requirements to maintain a successful poker career. Optimum decision making requires an ability to see through statistical noise.  Short term results, while appealing, can’t be the focus of poker analysis. Realizing that all these traits could be applied to much larger problems, I began my transition into the field of data science.

<big>Data Science Transition</big>

Luckily, I had plenty of help in my transition.  A good childhood friend had already made the seemingly unique transition from poker player to data scientist. I say seemingly unique, as strangely enough it seems many poker professionals have realized the similarity in data analysis and poker analysis, among the most famous FiveThiryEight’s founder Nate Silver. From professional poker player to data scientist enthusiast, my journey began.  There were, and still are, plenty of roadblocks and wrong turns along the path.  My friend has acted as my own stack overflow the entire time, and I owe much of the success I have had in learning such a diverse field to him.  Eventually I felt confident enough to complete the Data Scientist track on DataQuest(2017), and with a formal understanding and a  strong foundation in Python I decided it was time to formalize my education.  I applied and was accepted into CUNY SPS Master Data Science spring class in 2018

<big> Graduate degree</big>
Equipped with a strong understanding of Python, I entered my first semester ready to take on the world.  Only to find out that neither class I would take first semester would be using Pyhton, instead, they would be focusing on R.  While python is becoming the open source language of choice all throughout the data community, academia still largely prefers the statistical capabilities of R.  This was frightening, I struggled for several years devoting much effort to learning Python.  Now I would need to learn an entirely new language in under a semester.  In addition, I would need to preserve enough time to spread around between my other math classes, as well as my studies in poker and the need to make a living with poker. The first semester in the program was difficult, but I came out of the first semester with a strong understanding of R, and a preference for using it over python.

        <p> Final semester student in Master in Data Science program at CUNY SPS. Profesional poker player since sophmore year of college. Poker has given me an amazing oppurtunity
  to make a living in an area that most people can only envision as a hobby. I am pasisonate about data and eager to start my journey in the field of data science
